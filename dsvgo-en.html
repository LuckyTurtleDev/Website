</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed,
		information about the data being processed, further information about the
		nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15
		GDPR);
	</li>
	<li>
		to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
	</li>
	<li>
		to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO),
		or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art.
		17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
	</li>
	<li>
		to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to

	In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it
	discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on
	processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation

<h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
<p>
	Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon
	as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the
	same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise
	stipulated below.
</p>
<h4>Social media links via graphics</h4>
<p>
	We also integrate the following social media sites into our website. The
	integration takes place via a linked graphic of the respective site. The use
	of these graphics stored on our own servers prevents the automatic connection
	to the servers of these networks for their display. Only by clicking on the
	corresponding graphic will you be forwarded to the service of the respective
	social network.
</p>
<p>
	Once you click, that network may record information about you and your visit
	to our site. It cannot be ruled out that such data will be processed in the
	United States.
</p>
<p>
	Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date and
	time of your visit, and the page visited. If you are logged into your user
	account on that network, however, the network operator might assign the
	information collected about your visit to our site to your personal account.
	If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this information can be stored
	your personal user account and possibly posted on the respective network. To
	prevent this, you need to log out of your social media account before clicking
	on the graphic. The various social media networks also offer settings that you
	can configure accordingly.
