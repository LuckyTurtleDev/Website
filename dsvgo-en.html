</p>
<p>
	Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection
	Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any
	operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization,
	structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
	disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available,
	alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on
	personal data, whether by automated means or not.
</p>
<p>
	The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the
	type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such
	data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also
	inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our
	website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties
	also processing data they collect and control.
</p>
<p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
<p>
	I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br />II. The rights of
	users and data subjects<br />III. Information about the data processing
</p>

	protection law is:

<h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
<p>
	With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users
	and data subjects have the right
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
		to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed,
		information about the data being processed, further information about the
		nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15
		GDPR);
	</li>
	<li>
		to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
	</li>
	<li>
		to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO),
		or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art.
		17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
	</li>
	<li>
		to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to
		have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20
		GDPR);
	</li>
	<li>
		to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data
		concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data
		protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it
	discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on
	processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation
	does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
	disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about
	these recipients.
</p>
<p>
	<strong
		>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to
		object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art.
		6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for
		the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong

</p>
<h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
<p>
	Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon
	as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the
	same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise
	stipulated below.
</p>
<h4>Social media links via graphics</h4>
<p>
	We also integrate the following social media sites into our website. The
	integration takes place via a linked graphic of the respective site. The use
	of these graphics stored on our own servers prevents the automatic connection
	to the servers of these networks for their display. Only by clicking on the
	corresponding graphic will you be forwarded to the service of the respective
	social network.
</p>
<p>
	Once you click, that network may record information about you and your visit
	to our site. It cannot be ruled out that such data will be processed in the
	United States.
</p>
<p>
	Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date and
	time of your visit, and the page visited. If you are logged into your user
	account on that network, however, the network operator might assign the
	information collected about your visit to our site to your personal account.
	If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this information can be stored
	your personal user account and possibly posted on the respective network. To
	prevent this, you need to log out of your social media account before clicking
	on the graphic. The various social media networks also offer settings that you
	can configure accordingly.

	The following social networks are integrated into our site by linked graphics:
